Building (image creation uses "sudo"):
make                       Create everything
make image                 Create distribution/full_sd_image.img (and all dependencies => everything)
make sd_content            Create all files in distribution/SD_CONTENT
make rootfs.jffs2          Create distribution/SD_CONTENT/rootfs.jffs2 
make mca_card.bin          Create distribution/SD_CONTENT/mca_card.bin (APEX_SD + zImage)

Additional targets for convenience: (dependencies for the above targets)
make zImage                Create KERNEL/zImage_packing/zImage
make apex_sd.bin           Update BLOBS/apex_sd.bin
make apex_flash.bin        Update BLOBS/apex_flash.bin
make mca_cam.upb           Update BLOBS/mca_cam.upb
make rootfs                Upadate ROOTFS

Cleaning:
make clean                 Delete intermediate files
make distclean             Also delete distribution-files
